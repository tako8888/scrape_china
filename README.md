I submit this as my 2nd project in the Lede course 2024 at Columbia University.

# Title
How the Chinese Internet sees "Nuclear Waste Water" from Japan

# Aimed to accomplish
My aim is to visualize the trend in the Chinese internet, which people cannot tell easily from outside of the world.

# Findings
I successfully scraped Xiaohongshu, one of the biggest social media in China. I found selenium cannot handle this and a library called [nodriver](https://github.com/ultrafunkamsterdam/nodriver) is very useful to do this.

# A section about what new skills, approaches, etc you used, or where you grew the most during the project
* The website seems severely bans scraping. The website detects an access of selenium, but I found nodriver works. 
* I did this scraping with saving local html files. This helpls me in terms of tracerbility or rebundancy.

# A section about things you tried to do or wanted to do but did not have the skills/time (but if you have more time you might do)
* I had COVID-19 just before this deadline. So, I couldn't refine analyze and visualization. 
* Just before the deadline, I found mistakes in merging table. I couldn't fix them.
